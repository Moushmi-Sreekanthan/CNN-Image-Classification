# Overview
In this notebook, we build a simple convoluation neural network using tensorflow to classify Fashion-MNIST dataset which is a dataset of Zalando's article images.

# Description
* Training Fashion-MNIST by CNN on Google Colaboratory with TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha.

# Dataset
Fashion-MNIST serves as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

The training set consists of 60k examples and test set consists of 10k examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes as mentioned below.

* T-shirt/top
* Trouser
* Pullover
* Dress
* Coat
* Sandal
* Shirt
* Sneaker
* Bag
* Ankle boot
